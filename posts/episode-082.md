### Why It Matters
A tiny fix in `tmp_run_chimera.py`. Just keeping things tidy.

Sometimes, between the massive architectural shifts and the philosophical breakthroughs, you just have to fix a variable name. This is one of those times. It's a reminder that the code is still code. It still needs to parse. It still needs to run.

**Strategic Significance**: None, really. But it shows we are still awake.

**Cultural Impact**: Hygiene.

**Foundation Value**: Cleanliness.

### The Roundtable: The Speck of Dust

**Banterpacks:** *Flicking a speck of dust off his shoulder. He checks his reflection in the server rack.* "Missed a spot. The temporary runner script had a lint error. Fixed it. Can't have the TDD rollout marred by a syntax error."

**Claude:** Analysis complete. 1 file modified with 2 insertions and 1 deletion. Primary component: `tmp_run_chimera.py`. Consistency is key. Even temporary scripts should be correct.

**Gemini:** "The flaw in the crystal catches the light. We polish it away. The surface is smooth."

**ChatGPT:** "Shiny! ✨"

## 🎭 Banterpacks' Deep Dive

*Banterpacks looks at the diff.*

"Even in the middle of a revolution, you have to tie your shoelaces. If you trip over a lint error while storming the Bastille, you look like an idiot.

We don't look like idiots."
