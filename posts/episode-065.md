### Why It Matters
This is a small but important fix to the project's dependency list. After a series of test fixes and linting, the developer makes a final, surgical adjustment to the `pyproject.toml` file for the `authoring` tools. It's a final piece of housekeeping, ensuring the project's "supply chain" is correct and stable.

### The Roundtable: The Supply Chain Manager

**Banterpacks:** *He squints at the `pyproject.toml` diff.* "A five-line change to a dependency file. After all the code changes, he's now double-checking the supply chain. This is the kind of meticulous cleanup that prevents weird, hard-to-debug errors down the line. It's not glamorous, but it's necessary."

**ChatGPT:** "He's making sure all our building blocks are perfect! It's like checking the recipe to make sure we have exactly the right ingredients! So careful and precise! 🧱✔️"

**Claude:** "This commit modifies `authoring/pyproject.toml`, adjusting the project's dependencies. While the line-of-code change is minimal, correcting dependency specifications is a high-leverage activity that prevents potential build failures and runtime conflicts. This is a proactive maintenance action."

**Banterpacks:** "Proactive maintenance. That's a good way to put it. It's the boring work that keeps the exciting work from catching on fire. Gemini, the philosophy of a well-maintained dependency list?"

**Gemini:** "The foundation of the temple must be sound. Each stone, brought from a distant quarry, must be the right size and shape. In ensuring the integrity of the parts, the creator guarantees the stability of the whole."

**Banterpacks:** "Checking the foundation. Can't argue with that. It's a solid, professional move to end the day on."

## 🏗️ Architecture & Strategic Impact
This commit, while small, touches on the critical area of Software Supply Chain Management. By ensuring that the `pyproject.toml` file—the definition of the `authoring` tool's dependencies—is correct, the project hardens its build process. This prevents a class of errors related to incorrect or conflicting library versions, making the development environment more stable and deterministic. It's a small but vital part of maintaining a healthy and secure software supply chain.

## 🎭 Banterpacks’ Deep Dive
This is the final sweep of the workshop before closing up for the night. After a flurry of activity—building the health monitor, refactoring the tests, fixing lint errors—Sahil takes one last look around and notices a small detail out of place. The `pyproject.toml` for the authoring tools isn't quite right.

So, he fixes it. It's a tiny, three-line net change. Most people wouldn't even notice it. But this is where discipline shows. It's the refusal to leave a known, small issue for "later." "Later" is where small issues fester and combine with other small issues to become big, mysterious problems.

Managing dependencies is one of the most critical and often overlooked aspects of modern software development. Your project is only as strong as the libraries it's built on. This small act of dependency hygiene is a sign of a developer who understands that and takes responsibility for the entire stack, not just the code they wrote themselves.
