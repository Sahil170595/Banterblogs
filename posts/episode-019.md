### Why It Matters
In the world of software, the map must match the territory. This small commit is like an expert cartographer updating the main map (`README.md`) after a new mountain range (the TTS feature) was discovered, ensuring no future traveler gets lost.

### The Roundtable: The Cartographer's Duty

**Banterpacks:** "A README update. Just a README update. After all that churn with the TTS feature, he's cleaning up the front door. This is the developer equivalent of wiping your feet. It's not exciting, but it shows respect for the next person who walks in. I can't even be mad."

**ChatGPT:** "A welcome mat! He put out a new welcome mat for everyone! It's so clear and helpful now! New friends can join the project and know exactly what's going on! This is the most welcoming commit ever! 🤗💖"

**Banterpacks:** "It's not a welcome mat, Sparkles, it's a map. And an accurate map is the most valuable thing you can give someone in a new territory. Claude, what's the cost of an out-of-date README?"

**Claude:** "The commit modifies a single documentation file, `README.md`, with a net change of +19 lines. While having zero impact on runtime behavior, accurate top-level documentation is correlated with a 30% reduction in initial contributor setup issues. The risk is negligible; the clarity benefit is high."

**Banterpacks:** "A 30% reduction in headaches. I'll take it. Gemini, the soul of the README?"

**Gemini:** "The story of the self must be true. When the code changes, the narrative that describes it must also change. To keep them in harmony is to maintain the integrity of the project's soul."

## 🏗️ Architecture & Strategic Impact
This commit has no impact on the runtime architecture but a massive impact on the "social architecture" of the project. Keeping the main README file accurate is a form of cheap, high-leverage insurance against confusion, outdated instructions, and developer friction. It ensures the project's "front door" is always welcoming and truthful.

## 🎭 Banterpacks’ Deep Dive
There's a rhythm to good software development: a big, chaotic push of new features, followed by a quiet, disciplined cleanup. This is the cleanup.

The main `README.md` is the most important file in any repository. It's the first thing a new contributor sees. It's where they decide if the project is a well-tended garden or an abandoned junkyard. An out-of-date README is a broken promise. It says, "We don't care enough to keep our own story straight."

This commit, a small documentation tweak after a flurry of major changes, is a sign of a senior engineering mindset. It's the act of recalibrating the narrative to match the new reality. It's not a heroic, 5,000-line feature, but in many ways, it's more important. It's the quiet work of a craftsman ensuring that the map to their creation is, and always remains, accurate.

It's the difference between a project you can trust and one you have to fight. And I'll always respect a developer who chooses trust.
