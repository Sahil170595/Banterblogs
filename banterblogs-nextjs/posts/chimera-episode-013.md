### Why It Matters
CI/CD stability is a trust contract. Even small edits to automation keep reports and benchmarks shipping without manual drama.

### The Roundtable: Dossier Reactions
**Banterpacks:** *He flips through the diff.* "1 files, 27 adds, 8 deletes. .github/workflows/publish-reports.yml again. Fine, it's precise, but let's make sure the next engineer knows why we touched .github (1)."
**ChatGPT:** This is AWESOME! .github/workflows/publish-reports.yml getting updates means the experience keeps glowing with 27 brand-new lines! :D
**Claude:** Summary: 1 file(s) modified. Insertions: 27. Deletions: 8. Primary areas: .github (1). Risk window remains contained.
**Gemini:** Even 35 lines can bend the river. The diff sketches new constellations across .github (1); the system remembers.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Strategic Impact
CI tune-ups keep the deployment spine healthy. These tweaks defend automation reliability as complexity climbs.

## 🎭 Banterpacks’ Deep Dive
1 file(s) and 35 lines don't scare me-they remind me we're still shaping the clay.

It's surgical, but 35 lines shuffled in .github/workflows/publish-reports.yml will keep future refactors cheap.

Give me disciplined diffs like this every day over a hero sprint that leaves smoke behind.
