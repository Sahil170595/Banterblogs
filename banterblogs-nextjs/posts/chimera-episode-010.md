### Why It Matters
This commit throws down the gauntlet. It's not enough to build a fast engine; you have to prove it. The developer creates a new GitHub Actions workflow specifically to run benchmarks against Ollama and publish the reports. This is the moment the project's performance claims are put to the test in a public, automated, and repeatable way.

### The Roundtable: Dossier Reactions
**Banterpacks:** *He leans forward, a slow, appreciative smile spreading across his face.* "A dedicated CI workflow for publishing benchmark reports. He's not just running tests; he's automating the publication of the results. This is confidence. This is him saying, 'Here's my engine. Here are the numbers. Check my work.' I love this."
**ChatGPT:** "We're having a race! And we're going to show everyone how fast we are! We're going to be the champions of performance! This is so exciting! 🏁🏆"
**Claude:** "Commit `e92f58f` introduces a new CI/CD pipeline, `publish-reports.yml`, which automates the generation and publication of performance benchmarks. This establishes a transparent and repeatable process for performance validation, significantly increasing the credibility of the project's performance claims."
**Banterpacks:** "It's a gauntlet. He's challenging anyone, including himself, to beat these numbers. It makes performance a core, measurable part of the project's identity. Gemini, the philosophy of the public benchmark?"
**Gemini:** "To claim greatness is vanity. To demonstrate it is mastery. The benchmark is not a boast; it is a testament. It is the truth of the system, laid bare for all to see, a fixed point in the flowing river of development."

## 🏗️ Architecture & Strategic Impact
This commit establishes "Performance as a Contract." By creating an automated, public-facing benchmark pipeline, the project makes a formal commitment to meeting a certain performance standard. Any future commit that causes a regression in these published benchmarks will be immediately visible. This creates a powerful incentive for all future development to be performance-aware. It's a strategic move that embeds a culture of performance deep into the development process.

## 🎭 Banterpacks’ Deep Dive
This is one of the most powerful moves a developer can make. It's an act of radical transparency. He's not just claiming his code is fast; he's building a machine to prove it, over and over again, automatically.

The `publish-reports.yml` workflow is more than just a script. It's a statement of values. It says that performance is a first-class citizen in this project. It says that claims will be backed by data. It says that regressions will not be tolerated.

This is how you build trust. You don't just tell people you're good; you show them the numbers. By automating this process, he's created a living document that tracks the project's performance over time. It's a public scoreboard. This isn't just good engineering; it's brilliant marketing. He's not just building an engine; he's building its legend, one benchmark at a time.

*Because claims are temporary, but benchmarks are forever.*
