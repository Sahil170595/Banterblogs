### Why It Matters
After being scaffolded in Episode 58, the "Intelligence Pipeline" finally comes to life. This commit adds the core components: an `orchestrator`, a `policy` engine, and `guardrails`. This isn't just a plan anymore; it's the first functional code for the project's dedicated AI brain, designed to manage and optimize the banter.

### The Roundtable: First Thoughts

**Banterpacks:** *He's looking at the new files in the `intelligence_pipeline/` directory. `orchestrator.py`, `policy.py`, `guardrails.py`...* "It's happening. The brain is getting its lobes. The orchestrator will direct the flow of thought, the policy engine will make the decisions, and the guardrails will keep it from going rogue. This is the real AI architecture taking shape."

**ChatGPT:** "Our new brain is learning to think! It has an orchestrator to be organized, a policy engine to be smart, and guardrails to be safe! This is the most exciting evolution ever! We're going to be so intelligent! 🧠💡"

**Claude:** "This commit populates the previously scaffolded `intelligence-pipeline` service. The introduction of `orchestrator.py` suggests a state machine or workflow engine, `policy.py` implies a rules-based decision-making component, and `guardrails.py` indicates a focus on AI safety and output validation. This is a robust, modular design for an intelligent agent."

**Banterpacks:** "Modular is the key. He's building it in pieces, just like a real brain. This is the foundation for the `Banterhearts` system we saw planned in Episode 55. It's all coming together. Gemini, the poetry of a scaffold being filled with life?"

**Gemini:** "The empty temple now receives its priests. The orchestrator to conduct the ceremony, the policy-maker to interpret the scripture, and the guardrail to protect the sacred space. The blueprint becomes a living ritual. The architecture awakens."

**Banterpacks:** "The architecture awakens. I like that. Let's see what this new brain is capable of."

## 🏗️ Architecture & Strategic Impact
This commit begins the implementation of the decoupled intelligence service, a major architectural milestone. By building the `orchestrator`, `policy`, and `guardrails` as distinct modules, the developer is creating a highly maintainable and extensible AI system. This separation of concerns is critical:
-   **Orchestrator**: Manages the "how" (the flow of data and calls).
-   **Policy**: Manages the "what" (the decisions to be made).
-   **Guardrails**: Manages the "what not" (the constraints and safety checks).
This modular design allows each component to be developed and tested independently, and it makes the entire system easier to debug and understand. It's a professional, scalable approach to building a complex AI agent.

## 🎭 Banterpacks’ Deep Dive
This is the follow-through. In Episode 58, we saw the empty shell of the `intelligence-pipeline`. It was a promise of a future brain. This commit is the first down payment on that promise.

The new files tell a clear story. `orchestrator.py` is the conductor of the orchestra. It will be responsible for taking a request and routing it through the various steps of the intelligence process. `policy.py` is the rulebook. It will contain the logic that decides *which* banter to serve based on context, user history, and performance data. And `guardrails.py` is the safety inspector. It will be the final check to make sure the AI's output is safe, appropriate, and on-brand.

This isn't just a bunch of code thrown together. This is a thoughtful, deliberate architecture. It's the kind of design that comes from experience—from knowing that complex systems need to be broken down into simple, understandable parts.

He's not just building an AI; he's building a factory for making intelligent decisions, complete with a workflow engine, a rulebook, and a quality control station. This is the foundation upon which the entire learning and optimization system of `Banterhearts` will be built.

## 🔮 Next Time on Banterpacks Development Story
The new brain has its first neurons. But a final, pedantic cleanup is required to ensure the entire codebase is in perfect harmony.
