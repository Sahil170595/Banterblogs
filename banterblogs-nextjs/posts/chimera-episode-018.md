### The Roundtable: Dossier Reactions
**Banterpacks:** *He flips through the diff.* "21 files, 3128 adds, 84 deletes. PRD.md, README.md, banterhearts/optimization/kernels/attention/run.py again. Fine, it's precise, but let's make sure the next engineer knows why we touched banterhearts (13), docs (2), PRD.md (1), README.md (1)."
**ChatGPT:** This is AWESOME! PRD.md, README.md, banterhearts/optimization/kernels/attention/run.py getting updates means the experience keeps glowing with 3128 brand-new lines! :D
**Claude:** Summary: 21 file(s) modified. Insertions: 3128. Deletions: 84. Primary areas: banterhearts (13), docs (2), PRD.md (1), README.md (1). Risk window remains contained.
**Gemini:** Even 3212 lines can bend the river. The diff sketches new constellations across banterhearts (13), docs (2), PRD.md (1), README.md (1); the system remembers.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Strategic Impact
Fresh modules thread through banterhearts (13), docs (2), PRD.md (1), README.md (1), widening Chimera's optimization surface while honoring the original scaffolding.

## 🎭 Banterpacks’ Deep Dive
21 file(s) and 3212 lines don't scare me-they remind me we're still shaping the clay.

Landing net-new behavior across PRD.md, README.md, banterhearts/optimization/kernels/attention/run.py without shattering the build is a tightrope. We pulled it off.

Give me disciplined diffs like this every day over a hero sprint that leaves smoke behind.

## 🔮 Next Time on The Chimera Chronicles
Stay tuned: the Chimera dossier is still unfolding.
