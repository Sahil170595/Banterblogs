### Why It Matters
After building the entire house in one day, this commit is the essential follow-up: a thorough inspection. Sahil is now walking through every room, tightening loose screws, sanding rough edges, and making sure the foundation is solid before moving in the furniture.

### The Roundtable: The Crucible

**Banterpacks:** *nods in approval.* "Okay, this is the commit I was waiting for. After the 15,000-line deluge, we get the cleanup crew. A net change of +347 lines, but with 241 deletions. He's refining. This is professional."

**ChatGPT:** "He's making it even better! It was already perfect, and now it's... perfect-er! 💖"

**Banterpacks:** "Nothing is ever perfect, Sparkles. The last commit was the first draft. This is the editing process. It's less glamorous, but it's where quality is made. He's not just running from the mess he made; he's cleaning it up. Claude, what's the churn analysis look like?"

**Claude:** "The churn is concentrated in the core `overlay/modules/` and `test/` directories. The pattern of deleting code and replacing it with fewer, more efficient lines suggests an increase in code cohesion and a reduction in complexity. The 'all suites green' message provides a 99.8% confidence level that no regressions were introduced."

**Banterpacks:** "A 99.8% confidence level. I'll take those odds. This is a developer who takes pride in their work."

## 🏗️ Architecture & Strategic Impact
This commit demonstrates a mature and sustainable development cycle: a "build and stabilize" pattern. By immediately following a massive feature drop with a dedicated refactoring and testing pass, the project avoids accumulating technical debt. This is strategically crucial because it ensures the new, larger codebase remains maintainable and robust, enabling faster and safer development in the future. For leadership, this signals a commitment to quality, not just speed.

## 🎭 Banterpacks’ Deep Dive
Any developer can write a lot of code. The great ones know when to delete it.

After the fireworks of the last commit, this one is quiet, methodical, and arguably more important. Sahil is now doing the janitorial work that separates a prototype from a product. He's looking at the code he just wrote and asking, "How can this be better? Simpler? More robust?"

He touched 13 files, but the key is *what* he touched: the core modules like the orchestrator and the bus, and the test setup itself. He's hardening the engine and improving the tools used to check the engine. This isn't about adding new bells and whistles; it's about making sure the existing ones don't fall off.

This is the kind of discipline that builds systems that last. The "big bang" gets the attention, but it's the steady rhythm of refinement that creates quality. He's proving he's not just a builder; he's a craftsman.
