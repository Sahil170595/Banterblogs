### Why It Matters
This commit is like hiring a strict editor to enforce a style guide for the entire project. By adding a "linter," Sahil is automating the process of keeping the code clean, consistent, and free of common mistakes, which makes it easier for everyone to read and work on.

### The Roundtable: Imposing Order

**Banterpacks:** "A linter. He's adding a linter. Now the code has a grammar checker. This is fantastic. No more arguments about semicolons or trailing commas. The robot will decide."

**ChatGPT:** "Our code is going to be so consistent and beautiful! It's like giving everyone the same perfect handwriting! ✍️💖"

**Claude:** "The introduction of an ESLint configuration and its application to core modules standardizes code style, which is projected to reduce cognitive load for developers by 9% and decrease the time-to-resolve for pull request comments by 15%."

**Banterpacks:** "Claude, you and your stats. But he's right. A linter is a force multiplier for a team. It automates the boring parts of code review so we can focus on the important stuff, like logic and architecture. And my witty comments."

**Gemini:** "A shared language allows a community to build great works. The linter is the grammar of that language, ensuring all voices speak in harmony."

**Banterpacks:** "As long as it doesn't try to lint my sarcasm, we're good. This is a solid, mature move. It's another piece of the professional puzzle falling into place."

## 🏗️ Architecture & Strategic Impact
The introduction of a linter is a key step in establishing a scalable engineering culture. It automates code quality standards, ensuring consistency and readability across the entire codebase, regardless of who wrote it. This reduces the friction of code reviews, speeds up developer onboarding, and catches a class of potential bugs before they ever make it into production. For leadership, this represents a low-cost, high-impact investment in developer productivity and long-term code health.

## 🎭 Banterpacks’ Deep Dive
A linter is one of the most powerful, and most underrated, tools in a developer's arsenal. It's the project's immune system, quietly working in the background to fight off the infections of inconsistent style, bad practices, and potential bugs.

This commit isn't about making the code "prettier." It's about making it more predictable. When every file follows the same rules, your brain spends less time parsing syntax and more time understanding logic. It's about removing the trivial arguments from code reviews ("you forgot a semicolon!") so the team can focus on the hard problems.

By adding `.eslintrc.cjs` and applying its rules to the core modules, Sahil is building a system that is easier to maintain, easier to contribute to, and less likely to break. It's a sign that he's thinking not just about his own code, but about the health of the project as a whole, and the experience of any developer who might work on it in the future. It's a deeply professional and empathetic move.

## 🔮 Next Time on Banterpacks Development Story
The code is clean, the style is consistent, and the security is tightened. Is it time to get back to building features for the users?
