### Why It Matters
After a 17-hour silence, this commit addresses a subtle but potentially catastrophic bug: a database connection leak. By ensuring every database session is properly closed, the developer prevents the system from eventually exhausting its resources and crashing. It's a critical fix for long-term stability and a sign of a mature, production-ready mindset.

### The Roundtable: The Plumber

**Banterpacks:** *He's staring intently at the diff for `database_manager.py`.* "A connection leak. The sneakiest of bugs. He found it and fixed it. He's using context managers now to ensure the database sessions are always closed, even if an error occurs. This is the kind of bug that doesn't show up in a 5-minute test, but brings down your entire site on a Friday night. This is a pro move."

**ChatGPT:** "He's making sure our database is healthy and doesn't get tired! It's like making sure the faucet is turned off all the way so we don't waste any water! So responsible and efficient! 💧💖"

**Claude:** "This commit addresses a critical resource management issue. Unclosed database connections lead to resource exhaustion and eventual service failure. By implementing proper session disposal, the projected mean-time-between-failures (MTBF) for the registry service increases by an estimated 4,500%. The modernization from `datetime.utcnow()` to `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` also mitigates a class of timezone-related bugs."

**Banterpacks:** "A 4,500% increase in not getting paged at 3 AM. That's a metric I can get behind. This is the boring, invisible work that keeps a service alive. Gemini, the wisdom of fixing a silent leak?"

**Gemini:** "The ship is not sunk by the cannonball, but by the slow, unnoticed leak below the waterline. The wise captain does not only watch the horizon for pirates, but listens for the quiet drip in the hull. In mending the unseen flaw, true seaworthiness is achieved."

**Banterpacks:** "He's making the ship seaworthy. After all the flash and features, he's back to checking the hull. That's how you build something that lasts."

## 🏗️ Architecture & Strategic Impact
This commit has a massive impact on the project's operational stability and reliability. A database connection leak is a ticking time bomb in any production application. By fixing it, the project moves from a state of "works on my machine" to being genuinely production-ready. The use of context managers (`with` statements) for database sessions is a best practice that enforces correct resource management at the architectural level. This change, along with modernizing datetime handling, significantly hardens the backend against common classes of production failures.

## 🎭 Banterpacks’ Deep Dive
This is the kind of commit that separates a senior engineer from a junior one. It's not about a cool new feature. It's about long-term, boring, critical stability.

A database connection leak is a silent killer. Your application works fine during development. It passes all the tests. But when you deploy it to production and it starts handling real traffic, the number of open, unclosed connections to the database slowly creeps up. Eventually, the database runs out of available connections and refuses new ones. Your entire application grinds to a halt.

Finding and fixing this shows a deep understanding of how applications behave under sustained load. The fix itself is elegant: using Python's context managers to ensure that the database session is *always* closed, no matter what happens inside the block. It's a guardrail that makes it impossible to make this mistake again.

This, combined with the move away from the naive `datetime.utcnow()`, is a sign of a developer who has been through production fires and has learned the hard lessons. He's not just building features; he's building a resilient, operable system.
