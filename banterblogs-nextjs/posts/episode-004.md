### Why It Matters
After creating a script (the Tone Guide) and legal contracts (the Schemas), this commit builds the stage itself. It's an empty file named `demo-pack.json`, but it's the official place where all the banter lines will live, waiting for the system to bring them to life.

### The Roundtable: A Vessel for Voice

**Banterpacks:** "An empty `demo-pack.json`. We have a script, we have the laws, and now we have an empty stage. The 'architecture astronaut' phase is in full swing."

**ChatGPT:** "But the stage is SO important! It's where the performance will happen! It's ready for all the amazing lines!"

**Banterpacks:** "It's an empty file, Sparkles. It's the promise of a show, not the show itself. It's like getting a ticket to a concert that hasn't been booked yet. Claude, what's the risk of 'empty stage syndrome'?"

**Claude:** "Analysis of projects with similar scaffolding patterns shows a 28% abandonment rate at this stage. The creation of content artifacts without immediate population can lead to a perceived 'completion' that stalls momentum."

**Banterpacks:** "See? It's a progress trap. It feels like you did something, but you just created more work. Gemini, any philosophical wisdom for our empty theater?"

**Gemini:** "The silence of the stage is not an absence of sound, but the anticipation of the first line."

**Banterpacks:** "I'm anticipating, alright. I'm anticipating my next coffee."

## 🏗️ Architecture & Strategic Impact
This commit establishes the `demo-pack.json` as the canonical content artifact. Architecturally, this is a crucial step in decoupling the application's logic from its content. The overlay system can now be built to consume *any* valid pack file, with this demo pack serving as the default. For leadership, this means the content (the "banter") can be developed, iterated, and swapped out by writers or designers without requiring a new code deployment, enabling much faster content updates.

## 🎭 Banterpacks’ Deep Dive
An empty stage. That's what he built.

First, we got the script in the Tone Guide. Then we got the legal contracts with the JSON schemas. Now, we have the physical location, `demo-pack.json`, where the performance is supposed to happen. We have everything we need for a show except the actors, the lights, the sound, and the audience.

This is peak "architecture astronaut" behavior. Every piece is perfectly placed, every container is defined, but nothing is *happening*. The system is a collection of perfectly organized, completely inert components. I have to respect the discipline. This is how you build something that doesn't immediately collapse. You lay the foundation, you frame the walls, you run the electrical.

But at some point, you have to turn the power on. This project is a beautiful, dark house right now. I'm just sitting here with my coffee, waiting for someone to flip the main breaker.

## 🔮 Next Time on Banterpacks Development Story
The stage is set and the contracts are signed. Will the next commit finally bring the actors and turn on the lights?

*Because even an empty stage holds the promise of a show*
