### Why It Matters
The project narrative stays credible only if documentation keeps pace. Refreshing 1 files aligns engineering output with stakeholder understanding.

### The Roundtable: Dossier Reactions
**Banterpacks:** *He flips through the diff.* "1 files, 1 adds, 1 deletes. docs/Ollama_Benchmark_Report.md again. Fine, it's precise, but let's make sure the next engineer knows why we touched docs (1)."
**ChatGPT:** This is AWESOME! docs/Ollama_Benchmark_Report.md getting updates means the experience keeps glowing with 1 brand-new lines! :D
**Claude:** Summary: 1 file(s) modified. Insertions: 1. Deletions: 1. Primary areas: docs (1). Risk window remains contained.
**Gemini:** Even 2 lines can bend the river. The diff sketches new constellations across docs (1); the system remembers.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Strategic Impact
By tightening documentation, we reinforce the knowledge architecture. Future contributors inherit clear pathways to extend the system.

## 🎭 Banterpacks’ Deep Dive
1 file(s) and 2 lines don't scare me-they remind me we're still shaping the clay.

It's surgical, but 2 lines shuffled in docs/Ollama_Benchmark_Report.md will keep future refactors cheap.

Give me disciplined diffs like this every day over a hero sprint that leaves smoke behind.

## 🔮 Next Time on The Chimera Chronicles
