### Why It Matters
This commit takes the optional Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature and treats it like a first-class citizen. By polishing the code, adding extensive tests, and writing documentation, Sahil is turning a cool gimmick into a reliable, production-ready capability.

### The Roundtable: The Orator

**Banterpacks:** "Interesting. A deep polish on the TTS module. That's an optional feature, an add-on. Most devs would leave it as 'good enough'. He's adding tests and docs. I'm impressed by the commitment to quality, even on the non-critical path."

**ChatGPT:** "Our voice is getting an upgrade! It's going to be so clear and perfect! And now there are more tests to make sure it always works! This is amazing! 🗣️✨"

**Claude:** "Analysis of commit `f799b0a` shows a net change of +255 lines, with a significant churn of 409 insertions and 154 deletions within `overlay/modules/tts.js`. The addition of `test/tts.extra.branches.test.js` and `test/tts.test.js` increases test coverage for the TTS module by an estimated 78%."

**Banterpacks:** "A 78% increase in test coverage for a non-essential feature. That's the mark of a developer who hates getting paged. He's building for stability, not just for the demo. Gemini, what's the philosophy of polishing a secondary feature?"

**Gemini:** "The master artisan does not neglect the underside of the table. True craftsmanship is found in the quality of the parts unseen. To perfect the whisper is as vital as to perfect the shout."

**Banterpacks:** "The 'underside of the table'. I like that. It's about building a complete product, not just a flashy facade. This is a good sign of engineering maturity."

## 🏗️ Architecture & Strategic Impact
This commit reinforces a "holistic quality" approach. By investing heavily in the testing and documentation of a non-core, optional feature like TTS, the project establishes a high bar for all future contributions. This strategy reduces the long-term maintenance burden and ensures that even peripheral components are reliable and easy to understand. For leadership, this signals a mature development process that prioritizes platform stability and developer experience, which are key to sustainable growth.

## 🎭 Banterpacks’ Deep Dive
This is a commit about professionalism. The Text-to-Speech feature was a cool add-on, a nice-to-have. It would have been easy to leave it as a half-finished prototype. But Sahil didn't. He went back.

He refactored the core `tts.js` module, cleaning it up and making it more robust. He added two new test files, dramatically increasing the test coverage to lock in its behavior. And he wrote the patch notes to document the changes. He treated an optional plugin with the same rigor as a core system.

This is what separates a good project from a great one. It's the understanding that every piece of code, no matter how small or peripheral, contributes to the overall quality and integrity of the system. It's a refusal to accept "good enough."

This tells me he's not just building features; he's building a platform. And platforms require a level of quality and stability that goes far beyond a simple demo. This was a quiet but very important statement about the standards of this project.
