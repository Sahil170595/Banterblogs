- Generation efficiency: GOOD CONTEXT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
============================
1. Level Up (Motivational): 2527.22ms - FASTEST
2. Rare Item Drop (Excited): 2797.72ms
3. Player Died (Encouraging): 3089.02ms
4. Boss Defeated (Celebratory): 3234.48ms
5. PVP Victory (Celebratory): 4369.26ms - SLOWEST TONE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
=========================
1. Motivational: 2527.22ms - FASTEST
2. Excited: 2797.72ms
3. Encouraging: 3089.02ms
4. Celebratory: 3801.87ms - SLOWEST PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS
==================== Consistent performance across contexts Motivational tone generates fastest Celebratory tone takes longest (more complex) PVP Victory context is most complex Level Up context is most efficient QUALITY ASSESSMENT
================== All banter samples generated successfully Context-appropriate responses Tone-appropriate language Gaming terminology used correctly Variations generated for each sample Emoji usage (handled properly) SYSTEM RESOURCE USAGE
=====================
- CPU Usage: ~11-13% (low impact)
- Memory Usage: ~67-69% (moderate)
- GPU Utilization: Estimated 80%+ (good utilization)
- Ollama Processes: 2 active processes
- Network: HTTP requests to localhost:11434 OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
===========================
1. PVP Victory context could be optimized (slowest)
2. Celebratory tone generation could be improved
3. Longer responses (PVP Victory) take more time
4. Consider prompt optimization for faster generation
5. Batch processing could improve overall throughput BASELINE ESTABLISHED
====================
This baseline establishes current Ollama performance:
- Average latency: 3.2 seconds
- Throughput: 13.8 tokens/second
- Success rate: 100%
- Quality: High (context and tone appropriate) NEXT STEPS
==========
1. Implement optimizations based on findings
2. Test with optimized prompts
3. Measure performance improvements
4. Compare before/after metrics
5. Document optimization impact FILES GENERATED
===============
- csv_data/baseline_test_results_1759099000.json (detailed metrics)
- This report: reports/baseline_performance_report.txt RECOMMENDATIONS
===============
1. Focus optimization on PVP Victory and Celebratory tone
2. Consider prompt engineering for faster generation
3. Monitor GPU utilization during optimization
4. Test with different model parameters
5. Implement caching for repeated contexts This baseline provides a solid foundation for measuring optimization improvements in Chimera Heart's banter generation system.
