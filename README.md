# Banterblogs

A Next.js-powered development blog that chronicles the Banterpacks project through AI-generated narrative episodes. This repository contains both the blog platform and the development saga it documents.

## 🚀 Live Demo

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/Sahil170595/Banterblogs&project-name=banterblogs&repository-name=Banterblogs&root-directory=banterblogs-nextjs)

## 📖 What is Banterpacks?

Banterpacks is a dynamic overlay system for live gameplay streams that turns big moments into shareable highlights. It adds a personality layer to live streams by firing contextual reactions in real-time when clutch plays, kills, or misplays happen. The system features AI personas (Banterpacks, Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini) who provide witty commentary and analysis of stream events.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time reactions** (<250ms target end-to-end)
- **OBS-friendly browser overlay** (no game injection required)
- **Weighted selection** with cooldown and deduplication
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)** module with emotion detection
- **Registry system** for pack distribution and updates
- **Built-in analytics** and Prometheus metrics
